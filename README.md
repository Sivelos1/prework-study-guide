# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This application is a small web-page aimed for use in storing notes taken during the Rutgers Full Stack Flex Online Bootcamp. I build this application not because it was a homework assignment, but because it would provide a unique space for me to take notes on the things I will learn during the bootcamp. I learned quite a bit about basic Javascript during this, though I still have a lot to learn.

## Tests

To test the JavaScript functionality, open the Console with Inspect Element. You should see several output messages saying "HTML", "CSS", "Git", and "JavaScript", followed by "Which topic should we study first?". Below this should be another message saying "Let's study ???!", with the ??? being substituted for one of the first four messages. The topic is chosen randomly, so to test to make sure all four topics can be displayed, refresh the webpage and mark down which topics is chosen for study. After a few refreshes, you should have all four. If not, something has gone horribly, horribly wrong.
